**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing hospital data to improve patient care, resource management, and operational efficiency. Using SQL for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for data visualization, this project provides a comprehensive overview of hospital performance metrics such as:

- Patient admission and discharge trends
- Department-wise patient load
- Bed utilization rates
- Average length of stay
- Doctor-wise patient assignments

The main goal of this analysis is to help hospital administrators make data-driven decisions by identifying trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization. The interactive Power BI dashboard makes it easy to explore patterns across time, departments, and demographics.

This project is ideal for showcasing data analytics skills using real-world healthcare data scenarios and is suitable for inclusion in data analyst portfolios.

**Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze hospital operational data and provide meaningful insights through visual storytelling using Power BI. This helps hospital administrators, analysts, and healthcare professionals monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

✅ Key Objectives:
📈 Analyze patient admission and discharge trends over time.
🏥 Understand department-wise patient distribution to optimize resource allocation.
🛏️ Monitor bed utilization to improve hospital capacity planning.
⏱️ Measure the average length of patient stay for operational efficiency.
🧑‍⚕️ Evaluate doctor-wise patient loads to ensure balanced workloads.
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Explore patient demographics (age, gender) to support healthcare planning.
📊 Build an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore data by department, date, gender, and age group.
📉 Identify bottlenecks and performance gaps to support decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project contains structured information about hospital operations, including patient demographics, admission/discharge dates, medical departments, doctors, bed allocations, and billing amounts. This data is essential for analyzing patient flow, resource utilization, and hospital performance metrics.

**Tools & Technologies**

The following tools and technologies were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the hospital dataset:

| Tool / Technology                   | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power BI**                        | For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing hospital metrics |
| **SQL (MySQL)**                     | For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation using queries       |
| **Microsoft Excel / CSV**           | Source format of the raw dataset                                     |
| **GitHub**                          | Version control and project sharing                                  |
| **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** | For creating custom measures and calculated columns in Power BI      |

**Key Insights**

After analyzing the hospital dataset and visualizing the results in Power BI, the following key insights were discovered:
👥 Patient Demographics
- Majority of patients are aged between 40–60 years.
- Female patients account for 55–60% of total admissions.
- Older patients (above 60) tend to have longer hospital stays.

🧑‍⚕️ Department & Doctor Insights
- Surgery and Cardiology departments generate the highest number of admissions and billing amounts.
- Certain doctors consistently handle a higher number of patients, showing specialization or heavy workload.

**Future Improvements**

While the current dashboard provides valuable insights into hospital operations, the following enhancements could further increase its impact and usability:

🚀 Advanced Features

Add predictive analytics using Python or Power BI Forecasting to estimate future patient admissions.
Implement a real-time dashboard by connecting to a live hospital database or API.
Include readmission analysis to identify patients at risk of returning shortly after discharge.

📊 Dashboard Enhancements

Add more interactive filters (e.g., ward type, payment mode, doctor rating).
Include patient feedback or satisfaction scores for quality monitoring.
Design a mobile-friendly layout or embed the dashboard in a hospital portal.

📂 Data Expansion

Integrate additional datasets like:
Lab test results
Operation records
Medication and pharmacy usage
Include financial analysis (e.g., insurance claims, cost per department).

🔒 Data Security & Governance

Apply role-based access for sensitive data.
Ensure compliance with HIPAA or local health data privacy laws.
